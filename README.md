# WorkDayPlanner

In this module you will interact with the WorkDayPlanner! Use this planner to save daily work tasks. 

The WorkDayPlanner allows you to keep track of daily tasks and work hours. 

When the page loads you are met with the current date and time. Below that, is where the tasks will go.

Each hour that is highlighted red will indicate to the user that it is the current hour.
